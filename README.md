# Bugger 0.3
<h1>Bugger the Bug Tracker</h1>

Bugger is bug tracking software that has a focus on being easy to set up, use, and administer. With a focus on minimalism, and ease of use.

Bugger is meant to help small teams identify bugs, and track them through the life of their projects, helping to ensure that old bugs don't pop up again.

Bugger 0.3 will focus on the following updates to 0.2
<ol>
  <li>Rebuilding the back end to make it less error prone.</li>
  <li>Switching to a relational database as it is better suited to Bugger's scale </li>
  <li>Making more meaningful fields to bugs to make the software more usable</li>
  <li>Adding in search functionality to help with organizations with lots of bugs/projects</li>
</ol>

(a noSQL database to replace the relational one would likely be a document database)

Bugger will be released under an Open-Source licence.

I would like Bugger to be developed by a team of 1-3 people.
